# RL_demo

RL_demo contains modifications I made while encountering problems running the code from the book "Hands-On Reinforcement Learning."  
Except for few lines of code that didn't run successfully, the rest of the code has been tested and runs correctly in a Linux environment. 
I hope these modified RL demos will be helpful in your reinforcement learning studies.
